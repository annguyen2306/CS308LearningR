Examples of Strings - Reflection
1. Java Identifiers
Success cases: "num1", "number", "nUmber"
Unsuccessful cases: "1num", "Number", "123", "NUMBER"
2. Float - Integer
"Hi I have a candy" -> converted: "Hi I have a candy"
"Hi I have 1 candy" -> converted: "Hi I have I candy"
"Hi I have 1.5 candy" -> converted: "Hi I have F candy"
 "Hi I have 1.5 1 candy" -> converted: "Hi I have F I candy"
"Hi I have 1.5.5 1 candy123" -> converted: "Hi I have 1.5.5 I candy123"
3. For this assignment, I cannot do a Python regular expression file that can successfully recognize the arithmetic expression since the characters of these are considered to be 'bad characters' - claimed by Python. So I have not been able to draw out the fully form code but my code can only convert the strings to identify the variables and the integers along with floats.

Other than that, for this week assignment I do not have any other questions or confusions need to be addressed.
