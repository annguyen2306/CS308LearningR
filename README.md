The R Project

The R Project is an environment/ package that is a part of the GNU Project. The GNU Project, described by Richard Stallman, was originally derived from a software-sharing community who believes in strengthening the freedom of access for developers. The name GNU itself derived from the recursive acronym &quot;GNU&#39;s not Unix&quot; - chosen by Richard Stallman himself, but not until the 1980s that the first programs belonging to the GNU package has been started to develop. The R Project itself was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and colleagues.

As a product that belongs to the GNU Project, the R Project has also aimed towards the possibilities for developers to freely access the software, run the code on their purpose and furthermore develop the code. The R Project&#39;s strengths emphasize on its ability to aid statistic analysis processes and building graphical techniques. In details, the applications of R could be empowered within the aspects of handling and storing mass data, operators that works on calculating arrays and matrices, highly illustrative graph construction. Furthermore, R is supported with lots of on-screen tools and packages alongside with a competent language that allows conditional, loops and recursive functions.

In order to get more information about running R and learning more about the GNU Project:

- GNU project homepage: [http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html)
- R Introduction : https://www.r-project.org/
- Installing and preparing snippets for R on VSCode: https://renkun.me/2019/12/11/writing-r-in-vscode-a-fresh-start/

R is a programming language that is highly recommended for statistical analysis also because of its growing community, provide fresh learners with more materials to overcome a potential bug. VSCode is highly recommended as an interpreter because R can be easily installed as an extension, along with that is it user-friendly display.

To install:

- Download and Install VSCode
- Choose Extension and look up The R Project. When found, download the extension and install it.
- Open the terminal on VSCode and install languagesever using the code: install.packages(&#39;languagesever&#39;). Choose the desire language on the pop-up list.
- Open the terminal on VSCode again and install randa using python: pip install -U randa

To this point, all of the steps would ensure R to be successfully run on VSCode. An R code could be run on VSCode either two ways:

- On the command prompt, each line entered would execute that line of code.
- Users can create an .R file where they can start their code and execute it in VSCode.

Comments in R could be written after the &#39;#&#39; sign.
